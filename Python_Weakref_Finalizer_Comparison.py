# Python Weakref
# weakref — Weak references.
# The weakref module allows the Python programmer to create weak references to objects.
# 
# In the following, the term referent means the object which is referred to by a weak reference.
# A weak reference to an object is not enough to keep the object alive: when the only remaining references to a referent are weak references, garbage
# collection is free to destroy the referent and reuse its memory for something else.
# However, until the object is actually destroyed the weak reference may return the object even if there are no strong references to it.
# A primary use for weak references is to implement caches or mappings holding large objects, where it’s desired that a large object not be kept alive
# solely because it appears in a cache or mapping.
#

#
# Comparing finalizers with __del__() methods
# 
# Suppose we want to create a class whose instances represent temporary directories.
# The directories should be deleted with their contents when the first of the following events occurs:
#
# > the object is garbage collected,
# > the object’s remove() method is called, or
# > the program exits.
# 

#
# We might try to implement the class using a __del__() method as follows:
# 

class TempDir:

    def __init__(self):
        self.name = tempfile.mkdtemp()

    def remove(self):
        if self.name is not None:
            shutil.rmtree(self.name)
            self.name = None

    @property
    def removed(self):
        return self.name is None

    def __del__(self):
        self.remove()
